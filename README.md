# FischingC

### A simple text-based fishing game, inspired by Roblox Fisch

## Why I made this

I'm not the biggest fan of Fisch, in fact I hate (I know that that's a strong word but it's true) it so much.

It's just that, at its core, it's a simple game. So simple that if you've read my profile's README.md, you'd know that I'm new to this and I'm learning to code. So maybe, if I made a game inspired by something as simple as Fisch, then maybe I'd slowly start to get better at coding?

#### The AMAZING pun is, if you haven't noticed it, FischingC ---> (aim of game to fish, inspired by Fisch) Fisching Sea (coded in C) :)
